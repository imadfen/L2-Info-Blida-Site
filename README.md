# L2-Info-Blida-Site
### Platform for the students of second year in Computer Science of Saad Dahlab University.

  This platform created using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySql data base. Made to help the users finding their courses and university files and organize them in one platform using a third-party online cloud, hopefuly the site will depend on itself for storing files in future. The website also containes some usefull pages for the students, like the announcements page and the marks tables. The website uses log-in system, so users need to sign up and log in to access the pages.

I released this website at September 19th,2022.
